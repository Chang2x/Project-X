Functional Requirements

R01: The system shall record roll call attendance.
R02: Only registered devices shall be allowed in the system.
R03: The system shall support location-based (GPS) verification to confirm student attendance.
R04: The system shall validate the user against the QR.
R05: The system shall enforce OTP authentication to enhance security.
R06: The system shall generate the following reports:

Attendance

List of Students

List of Lecturers

List of Courses

Students’ enrolment per course

R07: The system shall enable the Administrator to capture student pictures using a registered device and store:

A passport-style photo

The student’s name and university ID

The photo as a file and the student’s details in the database

R08: The system shall support three primary roles:

Administrator

Instructors

Students

R09: Authorized users shall be able to:

Use a registered phone, tablet, or computer to identify students.

Register phones for attendance tracking and link them to a specific authorized user.

Locate a lost registered lecturer's phone.

R10: Authorized users shall be able to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on courses.
R11: Only authorized users shall assign schedules and enrol students.
R12: Authorized users shall scan students' QR codes to record attendance in real time.
R13: Authorized users shall remove students from a course if they drop out.
R14: Authorized users shall access all course-related data, including student enrolment, attendance records, and course details. This access is controlled by the authorization system.

R15: Students shall be able to view their attendance records in the provided interface for attendance verification.
R16: Students shall NOT be allowed to modify or delete attendance records.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Non-Functional Requirements
R17: The database shall be hosted on a cloud server.
R18: Database System feature access shall be restricted to authenticated users via a secure API.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Testing Requirements
R19: Testing shall be conducted at multiple levels:

User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Validate system compliance with client expectations.

System Testing: Ensure seamless integration of all system components.

Unit Testing: Verify the correct functionality of individual components.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation Requirements
R20: The system’s formal documentation shall include:

System Requirements

System Design

User Acceptance Test (UAT)

R21: The documentation and code should be persisted in a Version Management tool like GIT to control versioning, team sharing, and safe keeping.
R22: GIT repositories should be made available to the client.

R23: The system’s high-level documentation shall include:

A High-Level Use Case Diagram representing system interactions and workflows.

A High-Level UML Diagram illustrating relationships between system entities.

A Conceptual Diagram providing a high-level representation of system architecture, key components, and their interactions.

R24: Proof of Conceptual Model Review shall be provided.

R25: A Project Plan shall be created, including:

A breakdown matrix of what is to be done by when.

Plan and actual columns for tracking progress.

R26: Detailed design documentation shall include:

Component Diagram

Class Diagram showing classes and methods

Activity diagrams

At least 1 detailed sequence diagram

R27: Evidence of a Detailed Design Review shall be provided.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Implementation Requirements
R28: The code shall be clear, well-structured, and well-commented with standard headers for:

Classes

Methods

R29: Evidence of daily team standups shall be maintained, including:

A record for each person

What they did yesterday

What they are doing today

Any impediments (things that are stopping them from progressing)

R30: Evidence of Code Reviews shall be maintained, including:

Who is presenting the code

Who is reviewing the code

Printed copies of the code being reviewed shall be made available to reviewers a day before the review.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Final Output Requirements
R31: The final output shall include:

Working code

Demonstration of the working code
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General Requirements
R32: It is not expected that all requirements will be implemented in great detail.
R33: Familiarity with each step of the process is more important than full implementation.
R34: Time management is critical to ensure the project does not overrun the deadline.
R35: A working project that is partially feature-complete is more important than a non-working project.
